  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>It is a dough filled with meat, vegetables or fruits baked or fried in oil or fat</p> 
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>flour</li>
    <li>butter</li>
    <li>salt</li>
    <li>yeast</li>
    <li>water</li>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, add the corn flour, salt, and sugar and mix, then add the water and knead.</li>
    <li>When we have a homogeneous dough, we form a ball, cover it with a cloth and make the filling.</li>
    <li>Cook the chicken breast in boiling salted water until soft.</li>
    <li>When it has lost temperature, shred the chicken meat.</li>
    <li>Peel and chop the garlic and onion.</li>
    <li>Saut√© the garlic and onion in a pan with oil</li>
    <li>Add the shredded chicken breast, cumin, pepper, turmeric, salt and mix. Let it cook for a few minutes, add the tomato sauce and mix.</li>
    <li>We make balls with the dough and flatten them on a floured surface.</li>
    <li>We place a little of the chicken mixture on top of each empanada.</li>
    <li>We fold and flatten the edges well so that the filling does not come out.</li>
    <li>We fry the empanadas in plenty of hot oil.</li>
    <li>We take them out on kitchen paper to remove excess fat and that's it!</li>
  </ol>
