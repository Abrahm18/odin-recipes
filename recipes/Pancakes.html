  </fieldset> 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>  
      <li>1 cup plain flour (125 g)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
      <li>2 dessert spoons of baking powder or baking powder</li>
      <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
      <li>1 cup of milk (175 ml)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil or melted unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>First, mix the flour in a bowl along with the sugar, baking powder or yeast and salt. Then reserve the mixture.</li>
      <li>In another bowl, mix the milk together with the oil or melted butter and the egg.</li>
      <li>You must add the mixture of flour, sugar, baking powder and salt to the bowl of milk with the egg. Mix but without doing it excessively. It doesn't matter if there are small lumps left, as they will disappear with cooking.</li>
      <li>You should lightly grease a small frying pan with oil. Next, clean the rest of the oil with a kitchen paper and heat it on the stove. When the pan is very hot, add a ladle of the pancake batter.</li>
      <li>Wait for small bubbles to appear on the surface of the dough. That's when you have to turn it over and let it brown lightly on the other side.</li>
      <li>As you cook the pancakes, leave them on a plate, stacking one on top of the other so that they stay warm.</li>
      <li>Finally, serve the fluffy pancakes with nuts, chocolate chips, honey, some fruit syrup or melted chocolate. You will see what a delicious breakfast! Tell us if you have made the recipe and better yet, send us a photo with the result.</li>
